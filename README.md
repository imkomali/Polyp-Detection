## Business Objective

Machine learning and deep learning technologies are increasing at a fast pace with respect to the domain of healthcare and medical sciences. These technologies sometimes even out perform medical doctors by producing results that might not be easily notable to a human eye. Polyp recognition and segmentation is one such technology which helps doctors identify polyps from colonoscopic images

## Goal
To segment the polyps from colonoscopy images

The pdf file Solution_Methodology.pdf has the details for the complete methodology used in the project.

## Data and Code Overview :

CVC-Clinic database consists of frames extracted from colonoscopy videos. The
dataset contains several examples of polyp frames & corresponding ground truth for
them.The Ground Truth image consists of a mask corresponding to the region covered by
the polyp in the image. The data is available in both .png and .tiff formats
